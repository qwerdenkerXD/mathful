# mathful

This repo is just for implementing some stuff from the math lectures. Maybe it'll become a useful calculator.

## Install
```diff
- Currently the main method is empty because the base program is in development.
- In other words, the .jar file won't do anything.
- For the moment, you have to fill the main method in Main.java by yourself.
```

To make the program runnable, just run the following command in the program's directory. Obviously it's necessary to have java installed, otherwise it won't work.
```bash
$ javac *.java && jar cfe mathful.jar Main Main.class
```
To run the .jar file, just use the following command.
```bash
$ java -jar mathful.jar
```
